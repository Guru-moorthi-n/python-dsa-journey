## 🧠 Concepts Used
- For loop
- Arithmetic formula
- Recursion
- Functions
- Basic mathematical logic

---

## 🧪 Methods Implemented

### 1️⃣ Using for loop
Adds numbers one by one from 1 to N.

### 2️⃣ Using mathematical formula
Uses the formula:
Sum = n × (n + 1) / 2

### 3️⃣ Using recursion
Recursively adds numbers until the base condition is reached.
