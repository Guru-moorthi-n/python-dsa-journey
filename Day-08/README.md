## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Break statement
- Optimization techniques
- Recursion
- Mathematical reasoning

---

## 🧪 Methods Implemented

### 1️⃣ Simple iterative method
Checks divisibility from 2 to n−1.

### 2️⃣ Optimized method (n/2)
Checks divisibility only up to n/2.

### 3️⃣ Optimized using √n
Checks divisibility only up to the square root of the number.

### 4️⃣ Recursive method
Uses recursion to check divisibility step by step.
